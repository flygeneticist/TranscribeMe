## Transcribe Me

Transcription services scheduling and notes storage app. 

### Main Aim: 
The goal of this web app is to provide an all-in-one package for deaf and hard-of-hearing students to schedule transcription services and later access the notes taken from a session. The app will have a restful API. 

### Strech Goals: 
1. An Android application will be built to allow students to view the transcriptions in real-time, freeing up valuable screen space.
2. The Android application should be able to make use of the 3/4G network, wireless network, or mesh network(?) to connect to the transcription service, ensuring little to no downtime or interruption.

### About the Web App:
Users can create / schedule new events for which they require transcription services to be provided and view upcoming events. 
The creation of a new event will alert the department/college management, who can then assign a transcriptionist.
The app will send out an alert to the assigned transcriptionist one hour prior to the start time to help minimize no-shows.
After a event has ended, the transcriptionist can upload the notes from the event for all users who attended to view.
